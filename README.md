# C - Custom Shell & Unix Commands

Unix commands implemented: cat, grep, head, ls, mkdir, sed, sort, and tail  

## Shell
 * Multiple commands: cat sample.txt | grep ca | sed s/ca/replace > output.txt. User pipes are used to implement multiple commands.
 * I/O redirection: ... > output.txt (output of the commands is dumped into a file)  
 *  exec - exec can be used to only used one process (one pid) to execute multiple commands
